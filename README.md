# Intelligent-Agent-Chatbots

[Deep Natural Language Processing]


	[ChatBots] why are they the next big thing?
	“Conversation as a Platform” - Better customer service and they could even differentiate your business from the crowd. 
	Examples: Apple – Siri, Microsoft – Cortana, Google – Google Assistant, Amazon – Alexa, and Meta “Facebook” – ITS ALIVE.io, to name but a few.
	
	A ChatBot simulates human-to-human conversations with automated responses thus replacing the need for an actual human representative,
	thus, cutting a lot of costs and creating efficiency. Users in both B2C (Business-to-Consumers) and B2B (Business-to-Business) 
	are still using FAQs and raw-based Bots, now, what if we replace these with an intelligent agent utilizing the power of Deductive 
	reasoning using both KB (Knowledge-Based) on actual customer conversations in the past and Indcutive learning? 
	Harnessing the inductive learning capabilities of NLP through the power of deep learning that allows agents to more or 
	less learn and improve based on experience. These give a personalized feel to customers and better accuracy.
